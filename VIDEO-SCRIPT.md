## üîó **Level 2 Demo - API Integration (1:00 - 2:00)**

**[Screen Recording: Opening Level2-Task2-API-Integration.html]**

**"Next is my GitHub Repository Explorer - a dynamic application that integrates with the GitHub REST API. This demonstrates advanced JavaScript skills and real-world API integration:"**

**[Actions to perform while speaking]:**
- Type in search box: "react machine learning"
- Show real-time search with debouncing
- Use the filter dropdowns (Language: Python, Sort: Stars)
- Click through pagination
- Show the performance metrics updating

**"Key features include debounced search for optimal performance, advanced filtering by language and repository size, pagination for large result sets, and real-time performance metrics. The application handles loading states, error management, and provides a smooth user experience."**

**"This showcases my ability to work with external APIs, implement complex state management, and create interactive user interfaces that handle real-world data."**

## ‚ö° **Level 3 Demo - Performance Optimization (2:00 - 2:45)**

**[Screen Recording: Opening Level3-Task2-Performance-Optimization.html]**

**"Finally, my performance optimization dashboard - this demonstrates advanced web performance techniques and monitoring:"**

**[Actions to perform while speaking]:**
- Show the Web Vitals metrics updating in real-time
- Scroll down to trigger lazy loading of images
- Click "Run Load Time Test" button
- Click "Generate Full Report" button
- Show the comprehensive optimization list

**"This application measures Core Web Vitals - LCP, FID, CLS, and FCP - in real-time. It implements lazy loading with Intersection Observer, memory caching with TTL, and service worker integration for offline capabilities."**

**"The performance tests demonstrate load time analysis, memory usage monitoring, and network performance testing. All major optimization techniques are implemented - from critical CSS inlining to resource preloading."**
